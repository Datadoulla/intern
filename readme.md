# Internship applications tracking bot

Internship applications can be overheaded and keep tracking your application numbers and information could be even worse. To organise and simplify this process, I decide to develop a telegram bot. Telegram offers an complete and adaptable interface for my application.
I wanted the bot to get informations about my different applications, to stock those informatuons, to manage the potential update and to be able to produce some summary of the application process.

The first version of the bot application can achieve the first two objectives. 
Firstly, the bot can receive the informations about user's applications. Those inforrmations have to contain:
- an URL of internship offer
- the intern position
- the compagny

The bot process those informations and store them in a SQL database table. 
Once you receive a reponse to your internship application, you can update the status of the application trough the bot. The update informations will be store in a other table of same SQL database. The URL of internship is set to be the join key of two table. In the second table. You have the possibility to store:
- an URL of internship offer
- if you get an interview (Yes/No)
- the potential date of the interview.

## Installation

You can use this application in few steps:
1. Create a telegram bot

    BotFather is a natif telegram bot that help you create and manage your bot on the message application.
    To create your bot use the command keyword `/newbot` and follow the instructions. Once you create your bot, it comes with a token to access telegram API. Keep it, you will need it later.
    You have to set to keyword commands to your bot:
    - `/addapplication` to add application
    - `/updateapplication` to update application

    You can do all of this trough BotFather. You only need to call `/mybots` and follow the instructions. You are ready to clone the repository.

2. Clone the repository

    Copy and run the below code in your favorite command line interface.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Datadoulla/intern.git
    ```
    Once you clone the repo, you have to add ans .env file to store and protect the access to your sensible token to access telegram API.

3. Run the application

    At the step, you have two possibilities. The first one is more elegant. If you are familliar with docker, open your docker application and build the following docker image with the cloned repo Dockerfile.
    ```bash
    docker build -t internbot_img . 
    ```
    After that, you can run the application in a safe docker container excuting thi command line code
    ```bash
    docker run --name interbot  internbot_img
    ```

    The second option is to create an environnement and install the applicaion requirements.
    ```python
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    And run the main.py

    ```python
    python -m main.py
    ```

## Usage

The application utilisation is pretty simple but have to follow a strict format. To add track application, you have to call `/addapplication` keyword follow by the URL of application, a position one word description and the compagny.

Example:
> https://cacf.talentview.io/jobs/d9q8nk?source=carriere&utm_source=carriere DS (for data scientist) Cr√©dit agricole

To update an application, you need to response to the application message with `/updateapplication` keyword and precise Yes if you get an interview and the date of interview and No else.

I personnaly recommand you to host you application on api plateforme like *pythonanywhere* to have a perment access and running application.
